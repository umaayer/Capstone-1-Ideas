Capstones and Projects 

The opioid addiction crisis has created an alarming situation across the United States with death counts rising to an all-time high. 
	 A public emergency has been declared by the president and federal government, new synthetic drugs are infiltrating the system and killing thousands of lives each year. Recently, 
Fentanyl has been introduced and mixed with heroin, which can lead to devastating consequences. This proposal aims to delve into the problem by looking at the drug overdose data from one state, Connecticut, and conduct several tests, create visualizations, and possibly extract insightful information that can help state and public officials make more informed decisions regarding the epidemic. 



Opiates are prescribed to treat pain to millions of people around the world. Common legal opiate drugs include morphine, meperidine, codeine, hydrocodone, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, oxycodone, and fentanyl. In most cases, opiates are prescribed following a surgery or procedure of some kind. While they serve a great purpose in relieving pain, opiates have been the choice of drug to abuse, leading to opioid addiction and the destruction of thousands of families, households, careers, and lives.
Opiate addiction is rising at alarmingly high rates because opiates are highly addictive drugs. When an abuser who is addicted to pain pills takes an opiate, the drug enters the brain through the bloodstream, creating a flood of artificial endorphins and dopamine -- neurotransmitters responsible for feelings of reward, pleasure, and satisfaction. This creates a rush of happiness and euphoria. This high is so unlike any naturally-occurring rush of dopamine or endorphins that the only way a person can experience it again is by using the drug again.
After repeated use, however, the brain will stop creating dopamine and endorphins, limiting a person's ability to experience these feelings again to only when they use opiates. Because of the strong and desirable feelings that flood the brain, and because he or she cannot feel pleasure naturally any longer, it is easy to crave an opiate high. There are several steps toward developing this painkiller addiction. The first is tolerance--when a person has to use increasingly larger doses of opiates to experience the same high. Next comes physical dependence, when the body will enter withdrawal if the abuser stops taking the drug. Finally, psychological dependence, or cravings for opiates set in -- the hallmark of addiction.
Many people become addicted to opiates unintentionally. For some, they begin using the drugs with a legitimate prescription in response to an accident or surgery that would have caused them pain. By the time they no longer need the drugs for their pain, however, opiates have taken hold in the brain and cause a physical dependence.
The long-term effect of the use of opioid on the brain is significant as it changes the way nerve cells work in the brain. This happens even to people who take opioids for a long time to treat pain, as prescribed by their doctor. The nerve cells grow used to having opioids around, so when they are taken away suddenly, the brain has a volatile reaction. This results in unpleasant feelings and reactions, known as withdrawal symptoms.


The approach taken with this capstone project will include the following steps and projects: 
1. Extract the data 
2. Check for missing values and clean the data so that it can be used for further analysis (Data Wrangling)
3. Analyze and decipher new insights that have not previously been uncovered And/Or
confirm findings from previous studies (Data Storytelling)
4. Create visualizations and models to show the trajectory of overdose (Statistical Inferences and Machine Learning Techniques)
5. Provide conclusions and insights and their level of importance.
